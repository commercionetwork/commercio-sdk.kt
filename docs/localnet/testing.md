# Tests using a local network

SDK' tests can be executed by running a localnet full stack,
follow [this guide](https://github.com/commercionetwork/commercionetwork/tree/master/contrib/localnet) to find how to
start this net.

:::tip The process of starting the local network using the command `make build-docker-cndode localnet-start` can take a
long time because the `swagger` is generated; to avoid creating it, use the
command `make GENERATE=0 build-docker-cndode localnet-start`.
